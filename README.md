Hello and welcome to my page. Here, you will be able to see my growth in Web Development. I had a basic understanding of HMTL and CSS from classes in high school and college. After some time, I decided to restart on my education. I went to Udemy and bought a course taught by Dr. Angela Yu and am currently learning what goes in to making webpages. I hope you enjoy what you see.
